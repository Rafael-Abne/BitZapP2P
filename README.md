BitZap P2P - Client BitMessage - Node Js, React Js
============

Decentralized messaging system inspired by the whatasapp frontend using the bitmessage protocol with a focus on privacy, future plans will be put to run on an external server to make it available for anyone to use.

Bitmessage
============

Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.
